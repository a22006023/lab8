            <p>Welcome, I'm Robert Cachapa and I chose this course because I always took a liking for computers and
                wanted to know how they work. One of the things I'm enjoying the most is learning how to programm and what I can achieve with it.
                My hobbies are playing video games and skate and when I finish this course I would like to master my skills and put them to work on
                those areas and others.
            </p>
